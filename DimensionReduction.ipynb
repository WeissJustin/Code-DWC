    " *For example, when predicting house prices, we rely on training data to estimate the price of a new house based on its attributes. We use optimization techniques to improve our model for **accurate predictions**, often without worrying too much about the exact feature weights learned during optimization.*\n",

    "In <span style=\"color:silver; font-weight:bold;\">**unsupervised learning**</span>, the focus shifts. The goal is to **discover what really matters** in the given data. Often, much of the available data is redundant or irrelevant. In such cases, **dimension reduction techniques** help identify the important features and remove unnecessary information, simplifying the dataset while preserving its essential structure.\n",
